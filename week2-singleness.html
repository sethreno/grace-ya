        <h1>Review</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Many people are tricked into believing that their "real life" doesn't start until they get married. This lie causes us to miss certain opportunities and experiences, spending our time waiting for the next stage of life. <strong>What are some of your favorite things about being single?</strong> If you're currently married, what did you enjoy about singleness?</li>
            
            <li><strong>What are some of the negative thoughts and feelings we have about being unmarried?</strong> How do you think God views those negative thoughts and feelings?</li>
            
            <li>Sadie reminded us that being single doesn't mean we're forgotten. It can be tempting to believe that God has forgotten about us when we remain single despite our constant prayers for change—but God sees you no matter what your relationship status is. <strong>If you're single and desire marriage, how have you managed with the feeling of being forgotten?</strong> What other feelings have you struggled with in your singleness?</li>
            
            <li>Singleness is the stage of life marked by freedom. Whatever God's purpose is for your life, you will have the most time, energy, and margin to serve him while unmarried. <strong>How does Paul's view challenge our cultural perception of singleness?</strong></li>
            
            <li>In singleness, we can devote everything to serving God but, as Sadie and Christian noted, married couples have to put their family first. They don't have the freedom to be spontaneous or as generous with their time as single people. <strong>What aspects of singleness might you be taking for granted?</strong></li>
            
            <li>God gives us a purpose to live out right now—he does not ask us to wait for a spouse for our lives to start. Your singleness is purposeful, as will be your potential marriage. No season is greater than the other. <strong>In what ways—if at all—have you ever elevated marriage over singleness in your heart?</strong> What might God's purpose be for you today?</li>
            
            <li>Sadie and Christian gave some perspective on marriage, agreeing that it is good but it's not going to give you ultimate fulfillment. If we look for a spouse to feel complete or happy, we've made marriage an idol. We can't expect another broken sinner to bring us what only God can give. <strong>What could it look like to pray for contentment in God before you pursue a relationship?</strong></li>
            
            <li>Our culture has a selfish view of dating—we want to find someone to complete us. But dating isn't looking for your other half—it's an opportunity to find someone you can serve God with for the rest of your life. <strong>What are you hoping to find in a dating relationship?</strong> How might your dating life change if you were looking for someone to serve God alongside rather than someone to complete you?</li>
            
            <li>Sadie and Christian ended the session with a gentle reminder: don't neglect God's calling today because you're anxious about who will be in your life tomorrow. We can trust God with the totality of our lives, starting now. <strong>What would it look like to give your anxieties about singleness, relationships, and marriage over to God?</strong> What role could intentional prayer play in determining God's purpose for your singleness?</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>Bible Exploration</h1>
        <p>Most young Christians think that their ultimate goal is to get married. But the early church, especially the Apostle Paul, had a very different view. In 1 Corinthians 7:32–35, Paul not only paints a positive picture of singleness but turns our perspective of singleness on its head. <strong>Read 1 Corinthians 7:32–40.</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Paul specifically points out that unmarried people can be fully devoted to God because they're not responsible for someone else. They are free to serve God in whatever capacity they like. <strong>What could it look like for you to view your single season as a way to fully please the Lord with your time, energy, and resources?</strong> What opportunities is God giving you to serve him today?</li>
            
            <li>Marriage makes life more complicated. On top of continuing to serve God, the married person also has to serve their spouse and family. Serving your spouse takes time and energy away from doing things you might otherwise have wanted to do. <strong>Do you feel like the call to marriage is a call to give up freedom?</strong> What freedoms might you have to give up to be married?</li>
            
            <li>In verses 36–38, Paul says that those who get married marriage do a good thing. We agree with that—many of us desire to be married. But he goes on to say the man who doesn't give his daughter away has done even better. The idea that it is better to be single than married is a foreign concept in our culture. <strong>Have you ever considered that being unmarried could be a preferable option to being married?</strong></li>
            
            <li>Being unmarried gives you space to fully serve God and develop the gifts he has given you. Like Paul says, that doesn't mean everyone has to be single, but living unmarried is a unique, and increasingly rare, opportunity to serve God. <strong>What opportunities do you have to serve God in your singleness?</strong> In what ways is God building your character and gifts during this time?</li>
            
            <li>Paul's hope for the unmarried is that they would be happy (v. 40). In his view, singleness is a good thing that should contribute to our joy. We, however, tend to see it as a burden or punishment that keeps us from being happy. God is not making us wait for joy—he wants you to experience it today. <strong>How would you describe the experience of being unmarried—primarily positive or primarily negative?</strong> What are some of the benefits of being unmarried that you celebrate or enjoy more deeply?</li>
            
            <li>Our culture can make us feel like singleness is a bad thing, pointing out our flaws and damaging our confidence. But Scripture tells us that there is a God-given purpose for your singleness. His goal for you today is greater than finding a spouse. <strong>How will you serve God freely in your season of singleness?</strong> What could you do to take advantage of every gift, day, and opportunity you have for the glory of God?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Last Word</h1>
        <p>God has incredible plans for unmarried Christians. When we begin to see singleness as a gift of freedom, we will turn from the stress and anxiety our society puts on unmarried people. Your life does not start in marriage. Your value is not defined by the presence of another person. God's love for you does not depend on your relational status. God has a plan for you and a purpose for today.</p>
        
        <p>This week, take some time to thank God for the unique blessing of singles—ask him to help you see ways that you could use your single season as a door to live a more abundant life.</p>

        <h1>Deeper Walk</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memorize:</strong> Psalm 37:3–5, "Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness. Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart." (ESV)</li>
            
            <li><strong>Pray:</strong> Ask God to show you the purpose of your singleness. Ask him to open opportunities for you to serve him with the unique time you have in this season.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> If you're single, reflect on your day-to-day schedule and the way you spend your time. Consider how your spare time could serve God at church or in your community.</li>
