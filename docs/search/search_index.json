We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light.</li> <li>1 John 4:16 - And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.</li> <li>Philippians 2:3-4 - Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.</li> <li>Genesis 2:18-24 - the Lord God said, \u201cIt is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\u201d Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man\u2019s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, \u201cThis is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019 for she was taken out of man. \u201d That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</li> <li>Luke 6:45 - A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.</li> <li>Discussion<ul> <li>How do you know when you're in (romantic) love?<ul> <li>RE: \"Following your heart\"<ul> <li>Jeremiah 17:9 - The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?</li> <li>Proverbs 3:5-6 - Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.</li> <li>Proverbs 4:23 - Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.</li> <li>Psalm 37:4 - Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.</li> <li>Ecclesiastes 11:9 - You who are young, be happy while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>How do you choose a spouse?<ul> <li>1 Corinthians 7:39 - A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.</li> <li>Galatians 5:22-23 - But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</li> <li>Ephesians 5:21-33 - Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church\u2014 for we are members of his body. \u201cFor this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\u201d This is a profound mystery\u2014but I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>\ud83d\udcc4 With Your Church<ul> <li>Acts 5:29-39 - Peter and the other apostles replied: \u201cWe must obey God rather than human beings! The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead \u2014whom you killed by hanging him on a cross. God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.\u201d When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: \u201cMen of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.\u201d</li> <li>Romans 3:23 - for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</li> <li>John 14:26 - But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.</li> <li>1 Corinthians 12:4-11 - There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work. Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.</li> <li>Hebrews 10:19\u201325 - Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another \u2014and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</li> <li>Ephesians 4:11-16 - So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.</li> <li>Colossians 3:16 - Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.</li> <li>Spiritual Gifts Assessment</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Seth &amp; Krystal Reno</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udcf1 Seth - 816-352-6684</li> <li>\ud83d\udcf1 Krystal - 816-632-2830</li> <li>\u2709\ufe0f sethreno@gmail.com</li> <li>\u2709\ufe0f krvancamp@gmail.com</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#share","title":"Share","text":""}]}
