We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light.</li> <li>1 John 4:16 - And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.</li> <li>Philippians 2:3-4 - Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.</li> <li>Genesis 2:18-24 - the Lord God said, \u201cIt is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\u201d Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man\u2019s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, \u201cThis is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019 for she was taken out of man. \u201d That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</li> <li>Luke 6:45 - A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.</li> <li>Discussion<ul> <li>How do you know when you're in (romantic) love?</li> <li>Jeremiah 17:9 - The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?</li> <li>Proverbs 3:5-6 - Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.</li> <li>Proverbs 4:23 - Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.</li> <li>Psalm 37:4 - Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.</li> <li>Ecclesiastes 11:9 - You who are young, be happy while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth.
